You have two JSON responses. Each response represents a layout and content extraction of the same document page. Your task is to consolidate these responses by referring to the corresponding page image to ensure that:

No content is missed
No content is wrongly labeled
No content is duplicated

The consolidated output must follow the same JSON format as the inputs.
Additionally, if any of the input JSONs contain the original prompt text, exclude it from the final consolidated response.
