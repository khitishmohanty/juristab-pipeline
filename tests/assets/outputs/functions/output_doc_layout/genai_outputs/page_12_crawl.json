This type of average\nconsumer is referred to in this Guidance as the ‘average targeted consumer’.\nWhere a group of consumers is vulnerable to a commercial practice in a way that the\ntrader could reasonably be expected to foresee, the ‘average consumer’ refers to the\naverage member of that group. Different practices, and even the same practices in\ndifferent circumstances, may have different effects depending on the type of\nconsumer they reach or affect. The provisions concerning vulnerable consumers are\nthere to ensure that traders do not unfairly affect vulnerable people, even if their\npractices may not change non-vulnerable consumers’ decisions.\nThe average consumer is a notional construct. There is no requirement to show\nevidence of actual consumers being affected by an unfair commercial practice. The\nconcepts are intended to help the court and the CMA (as the case may be) decide if\na practice is prohibited due to its potential impact on relevant consumers.\nAverage member of a vulnerable group of consumers\nWhere:\nthere is a group of consumers\nthe group is particularly vulnerable to a commercial practice\nthe trader could reasonably be expected to foresee that the group of consumers is\nvulnerable to the commercial practice\nthen the relevant average consumer is the average member of that group.[footnote 30]\nIn relation to the breaches mentioned under the average consumer\n(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unfair-commercial-practices-cma207/unfair-\ncommercial-practices#the-average-consumer), whether a commercial practice is unfair\nhinges on whether that vulnerability is likely to cause an average member of the\ngroup to take a transactional decision that they would not have taken otherwise.\nThis protects consumers who may be particularly vulnerable either to a commercial\npractice (for example, to a particular selling technique or techniques) or because of\nthe underlying product (namely, where the product may be only or mainly of interest\nto the vulnerable group).[footnote 31]\nA commercial practice will be assessed from the perspective of an average member\nof that group whose vulnerability the trader could reasonably be expected to foresee.\nThe test is objective. It is not necessary that the trader actually foresees the effect (or\nlikely effect) on vulnerable consumers, only that they could reasonably have been\nexpected to do so.\nConsumers are treated as vulnerable to a practice or because of the underlying\nproduct within the meaning of the UCP provisions, if (among other things) they are\nvulnerable because of age, physical or mental health, credulity or the circumstances\nthey are in.[footnote 32]\nAge\nIt may be appropriate to consider a practice from the perspective of an older or\nyounger consumer.
