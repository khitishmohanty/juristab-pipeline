There are 32 commercial practices listed in the DMCC Act[footnote 10]  which are
unfair in all circumstances. These include fake reviews, misuse of trust marks,
pressure selling and sales of illegal products. These are covered in chapter 3.
The omission of any information that must be contained in an invitation to purchase
is also always considered unfair. This is covered in chapter 4.
Promoting unfair commercial practices in a code of conduct is also prohibited.  This is
dealt with in chapter 9.
If a trader engages in any of these practices they are acting unlawfully.
Top table alt text: Practices that are prohibited regardless of impact on consumersâ€™
transactional decisions include 32 banned practices, omission of material information
from an invitation to purchase and the promotion of unfair commercial practices in a
code of conduct.
Bottom table alt text: Practices that are unfair if they are likely to cause consumers to
take a different transactional decision include misleading actions, misleading
omissions, aggressive practices and the contravention of the requirements of
professional diligence.
Practices that may be unfair if they impact on consumer decisions
Other commercial practices are only unlawful if they are likely to cause the average
consumer to take a transactional decision that the consumer would not have taken
otherwise.
For a commercial practice to be a breach of the prohibitions on misleading and
aggressive practices, or of the requirements of professional diligence, it must involve
the conduct specified in the prohibition and the practice must be likely to cause the
average consumer to take a different decision.
When do the UCP provisions start to apply?
