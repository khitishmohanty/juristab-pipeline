  "fitz_extracted_text": "Overview\nThe Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCC Act) contains\nprovisions to protect consumers from unfair trading.[footnote 1] These provisions\nreplace and update the existing Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading\nRegulations 2008 (CPUTRs),[footnote 2] with some changes.[footnote 3]\nThese provisions of the DMCC Act apply to commercial practices which happen from\n6 April 2025 onwards. They maintain much of the scope and effect of the previous\nlaw. Traders can generally expect the same or similar requirements and prohibitions\nto apply to their commercial practices as under the previous regulations and\nconsumers can expect a similar level of protection. The DMCC Act also includes\nsome new or more detailed prohibitions of practices relating to fake consumer\nreviews[footnote 4] and ‘drip pricing’.[footnote 5]\nThis Guidance aims to help traders to comply with the unfair commercial practices\nprovisions in the DMCC Act.[footnote 6] It will also be of use to legal advisers, enforcers\nand consumer advisers in understanding what actions are prohibited.[footnote 7]\nThis Guidance updates and replaces Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading\nRegulations: OFT1008 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-protection-\nfrom-unfair-trading-regulations-traders).\nWho do the UCP provisions apply to and what do they\nprohibit?\nThe UCP provisions apply to the commercial dealings that businesses, referred to in\nthe UCP provisions as ‘traders’, have with consumers. Such dealings are called\n‘commercial practices’. They include anything traders do that could in some way\naffect consumers and the decisions they take. Chapter 2 of this Guidance explains\ncore concepts of the UCP provisions – ‘trader’, ‘commercial practices’, ‘consumer’,\n‘average consumer’ and ‘transactional decisions’.\nA person is a ‘trader’ if they conduct activities relating to their business or on behalf\nof another person’s business. The UCP provisions apply to traders’ commercial\npractices if they (for example):\nsupply their own products to consumers\npromote or supply another trader’s products to consumers\nbuy products from consumers\nhelp consumers to sell products to others, including to other consumers\nThe UCP provisions prohibit unfair commercial practices. These are practices which\ninvolve a trader misleading consumers, behaving aggressively, or otherwise acting\nunfairly towards consumers.",
