The hotels must comply with the UCP provisions in\ntheir dealings with consumers.\nExamples of practices covered by the UCP provisions\nPractices with the potential to affect both consumers and traders\nA trader sells spare computer parts over the internet. They sell a range of\ndifferent products. The trader needs to consider compliance with the UCP\nprovisions, if consumers may buy the products.\nA trader supplies waterproof clothing to retailers which market themselves to\nconsumers as suppliers of sustainable ‘eco-friendly’ fashion products. The trader\ntells retailers that all its products are comprised of a specified minimum\npercentage of recycled material. Although the trader does not sell directly to\nconsumers, the trader must ensure that any claims, statements or\nrepresentations they make to retailers are truthful and accurate because they\nrelate to the ultimate promotion or supply of the product to consumers.\nPractices by a trader where they purchase a product from the consumer\nA trader makes statements about the value of a car they might purchase from a\nconsumer. These statements would need to comply with the UCP provisions.\nPractices by a trader where they enable consumers to sell products to other\npersons (including other consumers)\nAn online marketplace designs their website to highlight featured deals, including\nlistings from consumers who wish to sell their unwanted and used household\nappliances. The online marketplace’s own practices must comply with the UCP\nprovisions. For example, they may be carrying out a banned practice if they\nfalsely state that a particular featured appliance is available for a limited time only\nwhen in fact the consumer has not listed it as such.\nWho counts as a consumer?\nThe UCP provisions define a consumer as an individual acting for purposes that are\nwholly or mainly outside the individual’s business.[footnote 19]\nThe words ‘wholly or mainly’ in the definition of consumer mean that an individual is\nstill a consumer when acting for dual purposes (a consumer purpose and a business\npurpose) as long as the consumer purpose is the main purpose.[footnote 20] Likewise,\nwhere a person engages in profit making activities, they may still be a consumer if\nthe main purpose of the activity is not part of their main business. This means, for\nexample, that:\na person who buys a kettle for their home, works from home one day a week and\nuses it on the days when working from home would still be a consumer[footnote 21]",
