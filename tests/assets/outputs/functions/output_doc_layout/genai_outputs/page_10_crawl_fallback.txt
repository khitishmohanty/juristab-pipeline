an individual who occasionally sells their unwanted and used clothes on an online
marketplace or sells their personal vinyl record collection to a second-hand record
shop is also likely to be a consumer[footnote 22]
an individual who invests some of their spare money in shares or property could
still be a consumer where making such investments is not part of their main
business
Conversely, a sole trader or a partner in a firm would only benefit from the protection
provided by the UCP provisions where, and to the extent that, they are acting for
purposes outside of their business. For example, a sole trader who operates from a
private dwelling and buys a printer of which 95% of the intended use is for the
purposes of their business, is unlikely to be a consumer for the purposes of this
purchase.[footnote 23]
What is a transactional decision?
‘Transactional decision’ is an important concept covering a wide range of decisions
that have been or may be taken by consumers in relation to products.[footnote 24] This
concept should be considered in parallel with the concept of ‘average consumer’
discussed below.
The UCP provisions define a transactional decision as any decision made by a
consumer relating to:
the purchase or supply of a product (including whether, how or on what terms to
make the purchase or supply)
the retention, disposal or withdrawal of a product (including whether, how or on
what terms to retain or dispose of it)
the exercise of contractual rights in relation to a product (including whether, how or
on what terms to exercise such rights)[footnote 25]
There does not need to be an actual transaction between the consumer and trader
for there to be a transactional decision. The concept is broader and includes
decisions on whether to do something or not to do something.[footnote 26] The wording
makes clear that transactional decisions may occur before a consumer has taken
any in-principle decision whether to purchase a product. It covers decisions taken
before, during and after a contract is made or a transaction takes place.[footnote 27]
Non-exhaustive examples of transactional decisions include:
whether to visit a shop
whether to click through on a website
whether to agree to a sales presentation or view a property
whether to buy a product
whether to sell a product (to a trader or another consumer)
