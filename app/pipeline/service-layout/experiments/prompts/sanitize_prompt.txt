You are provided with a JSON response and the original prompt that generated it.
Your task is to:

Review the JSON response.
Check if any part of the original prompt is present in the response.
If the prompt text is found within the response, remove it completely.
If any other items like field definition or element_object_schema definition are present, remove them. Only the layout and content and metadata should be present in the response.

Return only the cleaned JSON response with all traces of the prompt removed.
Ensure the original structure and content of the JSON response remains intact after cleaning.

Return a **valid JSON** with the following structure:
```json

    "correlation-id": null,
    "tag": "figure",
    "content": "AUTHENTICATED\nU.S. GOVERNMENT\n MATION\nGPO",
