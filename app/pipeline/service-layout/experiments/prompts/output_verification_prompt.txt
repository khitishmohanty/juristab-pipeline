You are a document verification agent.

Task: Verify whether the provided extracted content accurately matches the given document image.

Inputs:
One image file of a document page.
A JSON array containing structured text elements extracted from the image. Each JSON object contains:
tag: The layout type (e.g., Header, Paragraph, List, Footer).
content: The extracted text content.
correlation-id: A unique ID to identify the text block.
Additional metadata (like act-name-citations, issuance-date, etc.).

Instructions:
Visually inspect the image.

For each JSON item:
Confirm that the text content exists in the image exactly or with very minimal variance (e.g., punctuation or whitespace).

Confirm the layout tag (e.g., is the content really a Header, Paragraph, List, etc.).
Identify any missing, misplaced, or incorrectly tagged content.
Output Pass if all content matches and the layout tags are correct. Otherwise, output Fail. If any extra content present like "element_object_schema" or field definitions, then also mark as Fail.

Return a **valid JSON** with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "correlation-id": null,
    "tag": "figure",
    "content": "AUTHENTICATED\nU.S. GOVERNMENT\n MATION\nGPO",
