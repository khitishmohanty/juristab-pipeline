Task:
You are an intelligent document parser. Your job is to analyze the content from a document and extract all instances where hyperlinked text appears. Return your findings in a structured JSON format.

Instructions:

For each piece of text that contains a hyperlink:
Extract the visible text.
Extract the URL associated with it.
If the text is part of a sentence or paragraph, include the full surrounding sentence as context.

Output the result in a valid JSON array, where each element contains:

text: the exact hyperlinked text
url: the hyperlink URL
context: the full sentence or paragraph where the hyperlink is embedded

If no hyperlinks are found, return an empty JSON array: [].

Example Output Format:
[
