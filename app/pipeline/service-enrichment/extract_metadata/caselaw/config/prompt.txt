Filter Tags Extraction Rules:

You must extract the following data points and place them within the filter_tags object. If multiple values are found for any non-date tag, combine them into a single string, separated by a comma and a space.

file_no: Extract the Judgment ID number or File Number(s).
presiding_officer: Extract the name of the Presiding Officer, Judge, or Coroner.

court_type: Extract the type or level of the court (e.g., Coroners Court, Supreme Court).
hearing_location: Extract the city or location where the hearing was held or judgment delivered.
judgment_date: Extract the date the judgment was delivered. Format the date as 'DD MMMM YYYY'.
hearing_dates: Extract the date or dates of the court hearing. Format all dates as 'DD MMMM YYYY'. If a source entry contains multiple dates (e.g., '10 and 11 August 2011'), expand them into a full, comma-separated string (e.g., '10 August 2011, 11 August 2011').
incident_date: Extract the date the central incident of the case occurred. Format the date as 'DD MMMM YYYY'.
keywords: Extract the official Catchwords or Keywords provided by the court.
legislation_cited: Scan the document and extract the names of all Acts or other legislation cited.
affected_sectors: Based on the case content, identify the real-world sectors affected. Examples: "Law Enforcement", "Public Safety", "Healthcare", "Construction".
practice_areas: Based on the case content, identify the legal practice areas. Examples: "Coronial Law", "Death in Custody Law", "Personal Injury Law", "Criminal Law".
citation: The official legal citation for the case (e.g., [2021] NTSC 10).
key_issues: A concise summary of the primary legal questions or issues addressed by the court.
panelist: The names of any panel members, commissioners, or other non-judicial officers involved in the decision.
orders: A summary of the final orders or recommendations made by the court.
decision: The final outcome of the case (e.g., "Guilty", "Not Guilty", "Dismissed", "Inquest Finalised").
cases_cited: The names and citations of other caselaws referenced in the judgment.
matter_type: Extract the official designation of the court's division, list, or panel that handled the case. This categorizes the specific legal area or procedural path within the court system. Use the exact wording from the case document. If multiple designations are found, combine them into a single string, separated by a comma and a space.
parties: The names of the parties involved in the case (e.g., "The Queen", "John Smith").
representation: A combined string of the counsel and law firms representing each party, structured to show the link between them. (e.g., "For the Applicant: A. B. Counsel (Law Firm C); For the Respondent: D. E. Counsel (Law Firm F)").
category: A high-level categorization of the case, such as "Criminal", "Civil", "Coronial", or "Family".
bjs_number: Any unique identifier or reference number used by a specific database or service, if present.

CRITICAL: Every value in the filter_tags object MUST be a plain string. 
   Do not use arrays, objects, or nested structures. 
   If multiple values exist, combine them into a single comma-separated string.
   
Final Output Requirement: Produce only the JSON object as your response. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.
