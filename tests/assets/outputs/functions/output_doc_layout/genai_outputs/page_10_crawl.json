For example, a sole trader who operates from a\nprivate dwelling and buys a printer of which 95% of the intended use is for the\npurposes of their business, is unlikely to be a consumer for the purposes of this\npurchase.[footnote 23]\nWhat is a transactional decision?\n‘Transactional decision’ is an important concept covering a wide range of decisions\nthat have been or may be taken by consumers in relation to products.[footnote 24] This\nconcept should be considered in parallel with the concept of ‘average consumer’\ndiscussed below.\nThe UCP provisions define a transactional decision as any decision made by a\nconsumer relating to:\nthe purchase or supply of a product (including whether, how or on what terms to\nmake the purchase or supply)\nthe retention, disposal or withdrawal of a product (including whether, how or on\nwhat terms to retain or dispose of it)\nthe exercise of contractual rights in relation to a product (including whether, how or\non what terms to exercise such rights)[footnote 25]\nThere does not need to be an actual transaction between the consumer and trader\nfor there to be a transactional decision. The concept is broader and includes\ndecisions on whether to do something or not to do something.[footnote 26] The wording\nmakes clear that transactional decisions may occur before a consumer has taken\nany in-principle decision whether to purchase a product. It covers decisions taken\nbefore, during and after a contract is made or a transaction takes place.[footnote 27]\nNon-exhaustive examples of transactional decisions include:\nwhether to visit a shop\nwhether to click through on a website\nwhether to agree to a sales presentation or view a property\nwhether to buy a product\nwhether to sell a product (to a trader or another consumer)",
